    Project: Move Mania Polymorphism 🚀
    Repository: move-mania-polymorphism
    This program demonstrates POLYMORPHISM in Python.
    👉 Polymorphism = "same method name, but different behavior depending on the object."
    We’ll use both animals and vehicles. Each has a `move()` method, 
    but the action depends on *what it is*. For example:
    - A Car moves by "driving" 🚗
    - A Plane moves by "flying" ✈️
    - An Elephant moves by "walking heavily" 🐘
    - A Fish moves by "swimming" 🐟
     Goal: One method name (`move()`), multiple unique outcomes.

# Move Mania Polymorphism 🚀

> A fun Python project that demonstrates **polymorphism** using animals 🐘🐟 and vehicles 🚗✈️.  

Polymorphism simply means **"one interface, many implementations"**.  
In this program, different classes (`Car`, `Plane`, `Elephant`, `Fish`) all define a `move()` method,  
but each produces a **different behavior** when called.

## 🧑‍🏫 What You'll Learn
- **Polymorphism in Python** → same method name (`move()`) with unique results.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts:
  - Classes & objects
  - Method overriding
  - Using lists of mixed object types
- How to **keep code reusable and organized**.

## 📂 Repository Structure
## 🛠️ How It Works
  -- Animal and Vehicle are base classes (like blueprints).

 --Each specific class (Elephant, Fish, Car, Plane) overrides the move() method.

  --In the main demo:

  --All objects are placed in one list movers.

  --A loop calls .move() on each — without checking what type it is.

  --Python automatically uses the right version of move() depending on the object.

  --This is polymorphism in action 🎉
